# Computer Vision
## General Introduction
- **Programming Language**
    - [python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- **IDE**
    - [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
    - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- **Framework**
    - [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) (preferred to be used)
        - [Chinese document](https://pytorch-cn.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/)
    - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 
        - [Chinese document](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=zh-cn)
    - [Keras](https://keras.io/)
        - [Chinese document](https://keras.io/zh/)
- **Install** If you have gpu on your desktop you can install the GPU version(please note that install the consistent cuda, cudnn, pytorch [instruction](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/88903659)/tensorflow version [instruction](https://tensorflow.juejin.im/install/install_windows.html)), if not, you can install the CPU version.

## Plan in 2022 Spring
This semester, we will hold some seminars talking about classical networks and algorithm design! Hope everyone enjoys the learning together. 

The tutorial we will use is CS231n from Stanford University. (**Folder CS231n**) 

The plan is as follows:
- Week1-3 
    - Introduction to Computer Vision. 
    - Classical Network: LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet.
- Week4 
    - Generative Adversarial Network
- Week5
    - Variational AutoEncoder
- Week6
    - Object Detection: You Only Look Once (Yolo) family, R-CNN family
- Week9
    - Image evaluation index (metrics)
- Week10
    - Semantic Segmentation
- Week11
    - Contrastive Learning
- Week12
    - Transfer Learning, Domain Adaptation
- week13
    - Transformer in Vision
